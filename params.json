{"name":"Nastysloper.github.io","tagline":"","body":"### Hi! My name's Rich, and I write software.\r\nI am a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp in Chicago. Prior to coming to Chicago to launch my programming career, I was an Army Officer, and before that, a substitute teacher. I've always been looking for ways to make a meaningful contribution to society, and I love the challenge of writing good code and the potential to help so many people with the tools that I make.\r\n\r\n```\r\nputs \"Hello, world!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who am I?\r\nMy friends describe me as upbeat and energetic. Even though I'm ambitious and committed to continuous improvement, I love the feeling of giving back to the community and helping others. I recently took part in my first open-source event, and it was great. Contributing to open-source projects is something I've wanted to do for a long time, so it was gratifying to finally take steps toward becoming a contributing member. \r\n\r\n### What am I looking for?\r\nSince I'm a new programmer, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can continue to develop my new super-powers while making a contribution to your team. Somewhere where I feel like a valued player on day one yet have the opportunities to continually grow into more and more responsibilities. I enjoy pair programming and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with rapid development cycles. \r\n\r\n### Authored by\r\nRichard Vogt (@nastysloper)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
