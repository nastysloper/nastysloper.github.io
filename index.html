<p>I am a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp in Chicago. Prior to coming to Chicago to launch my programming career, I was an Army Officer, and before that, a substitute teacher. I've always been looking for ways to make a meaningful contribution to society, and I love the challenge of writing good code and the potential to help so many people with the tools that I make.</p>

<a name="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who am I?</h3>

<p>My friends describe me as upbeat and energetic. Even though I'm ambitious and committed to continuous improvement, I love the feeling of giving back to the community and helping others. I recently took part in my first open-source event, and it was great. Contributing to open-source projects is something I've wanted to do for a long time, so it was gratifying to finally take steps toward becoming a contributing member. </p>

<a name="what-am-i-looking-for" class="anchor" href="#what-am-i-looking-for"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What am I looking for?</h3>

<p>Since I'm a new programmer, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can continue to develop my new super-powers while making a contribution to your team. Somewhere where I feel like a valued player on day one yet have the opportunities to continually grow into more and more responsibilities. I enjoy pair programming and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with rapid development cycles. </p>
